Porcelain
=========

Porcelain is a work-in-progress to build a browser for the gemini protocol.
Its goals:

* compatibility with all properly implemented servers/pages
* enhanced security using OpenBSD's pledge(2) and unveil(2) via their Perl modules
* text-based interface (at least at first)
* minimal complexity of the codebase, maximal maintainability and readability to achieve the other goals

```
# pkg_add -U p5-DateTime p5-Curses p5-DateTime-Format-Strptime p5-Text-CharWidth p5-Any-URI-Escape p5-File-LibMagic
```
